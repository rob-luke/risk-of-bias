# Reporting & Reproducibility

## Reporting
One of the strengths of utilising this package is you can easily report how you reached your results. Record the software version and include the saved framework file with the questions and responses. This single file can be shared alongside your other reproducibility documents to demonstrate exactly how the analysis was performed.

## Reproducibility
Anyone else can run the same query with the same parameters to replicate your process. Large language models are not deterministic, so the identical query may not always produce identical answers. Nonetheless, being able to rerun the analysis with unchanged settings brings us closer to true reproducibility.
